#AirBnB clone - The console

this is the first part of the airbnb cloning project which consists of creating a web application this part we created a python command interpreter which we will explain below its use.

## Commands Interpreter

we create this interpreter with a specific use is which to manage data that we have in our database these data are in .json format which will show in a text file the data that we have added before.

## Usages

create the file `./console.py` we import the cmd module that is used to build custom command interpreters using methods to build that interpreter
you execute the file and it will show us the interpreter of commands ready to be used

## Command list

We will show a list of commands that were used in this project from which you can use

| command | Syntax | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| help | help or help command | shows the interpreter's commands which we can use and their description |
| quit | quit | Exit the command interpreter |
| EOF | EOF | Exit the command interpreter |
| create | `create <class_name>` | creates an instance of the class |
|show | `show <class_name class_id>` | prints the representation of an instantiated string as class name and id |

the commands that stop in the list are the ones that the interpreter recognizes and executed but for some reason executes a command that is not in the list the program detects it as an error.
if the line of the interpreter this empty the program will continue working correctly, also if we want to return to execute the previous command with the arrow up we return the command
